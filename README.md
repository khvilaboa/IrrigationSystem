# IrrigationSystem

System that allows to control remotely different crop areas, based on temperature and humidity rules. It can be configured both locally and remotelly, through:
- A local interface, with physical buttons and a 20x4 LCD.
- A telegram server, with commands.

Moreover, each irrigation line can have (optionally) a greenhouse and it will be possible to configure both the opening and closing of its door and the activation and the deactivation of its air extractor (if it has one).
